🛡️ Secure Document Management System (DMS)

A modern, blockchain-integrated platform for securely issuing, storing, and verifying official documents like certificates, transcripts, licenses, and more.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system is designed to streamline the lifecycle of official documents — from creation and issuance to storage, access, and verification — using modern technologies such as **encryption**, **IPFS**, and **secure database registries**.

It serves three primary roles:

- **Issuers**: Institutions or organizations that generate and issue documents.
- **Users**: Document holders who store and share their credentials.
- **Verifiers**: Third parties (employers, universities, agencies) who validate document authenticity.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📄 **Document Templates**: Reusable, customizable templates with dynamic data injection.
- ✍️ **Digital Signatures**: Tamper-proof signing for document authenticity.
- 🔐 **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption to ensure data privacy and access security.
- 📦 **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized file storage for durability and integrity.
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Verification**: On-chain registry entries for document issuance and validation.
- 🕹️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fine-grained permission settings (view-only, download, time-bound links).
- 🧾 **Audit Trails**: Logs for access, sharing, and updates.

---

## 👥 Roles & Workflows

### 🏢 Issuers
- Create templates and issue documents.
- Manage access policies and sub-accounts.

### 👤 Users
- Receive, store, and manage their documents.
- Share access selectively with verifiers.

### 🕵️ Verifiers
- Verify documents via QR codes, links, or through the app.
- Access only authorized documents with proof-of-integrity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite using Javascript
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot + Python service for OCR 
- **Storage**: IPFS (via web3.storage or Pinata) _TBD_
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts for issuance registry (e.g., Ethereum or Polygon)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (core), Redis (cache)
- **Security**: AES encryption, KMS (Key Management System) _TBD_
- **Authentication**: Manual (OAuth + RBAC) _TBD_
